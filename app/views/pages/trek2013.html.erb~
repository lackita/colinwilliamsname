<h2>What?</h2>
<p>
  In 2013 I will be participating in the American Lung Association's
  (ALA's) Trek Across Maine.  I will be joining the athenahealth team
  for the second year in a row, which has the goal of reaching 200
  riders.
</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
  There are several reasons I've chosen to participate, ranging from
  personal to predictable.  As many of you know, this isn't my first
  ALA event, it will mark the third year in a row that I've raised
  over $500 for the organization.
</p>
<p>
  So why the ALA?  Primarily I'm doing this to honor my grandpa's
  memory.  He died of emphysema in 2008, and it was extremely
  important to him that he would be able to prevent others from
  suffering the same fate.
</p>
<p>
  As for cycling, it's become a bit of a hobby for me.  As I approach
  30, it's becoming clear that if I don't take responsibility for my
  health it's just going to slip away.  As many of you know, I don't
  do a hobby halfway, so when I found a cycling event with the ALA it
  seemed like a perfect match.  Also, riding my bike's a whole lot of
  fun.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, I'm joining the athenahealth team for the camaraderie of my
  friends from work.  My first ALA event was the 100-mile Cycle the
  Seacoast ride out of Portsmouth, NH, in which the only companions
  were my wonderful wife and father-in-law cheering me on.  As great
  as that experience was, the intimacy of riding for eight hours with
  little more than my thoughts was a little overwhelming.  Joining a
  team keeps those emotional moments intact, but
